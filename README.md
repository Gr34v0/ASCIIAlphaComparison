# ASCIIAlphaComparison
This was a quick stupid thing I wrote when two friends were arguing the differences between two words from a base word, and my mind went to ASCII values for some reason despite it having no practical applications.

To Use:

1) Run the application. Currently command line oriented.

2) Type the base word you're comparing against and press Enter

3) Type a word you want to compare against the base word and press Enter

4) Repeat step 3 until you are satisfied

5) Press Enter without typing anything to continue past step 3

6) Readout will provide the difference in ASCII values for each word against the main word

7) type Y or N to either continue or exit the application.
